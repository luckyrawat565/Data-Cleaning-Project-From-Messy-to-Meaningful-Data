ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Project â€“ From Messy to Meaningful Data
Overview:
This project demonstrates essential data cleaning techniques using Python and pandas. The goal is to take raw, messy datasets and transform them into clean, structured, and analysis-ready data. This is a foundational step in any data science workflow.

What You'll Find in This Repository:

ðŸ§¼ Raw Data: Uncleaned datasets with common issues like missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and outliers.

ðŸ›  Cleaning Scripts: Python notebooks showing step-by-step cleaning procedures using pandas, NumPy, and regex.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Analysis: Visualizations before and after cleaning to highlight the improvements and insights.

âœ… Final Output: Cleaned datasets ready for modeling or reporting.

Skills Demonstrated:

Handling missing data (imputation, removal)

Dealing with duplicates and inconsistent formats

Feature engineering (date parsing, text normalization)

Outlier detection and treatment

Writing reusable and clean Python code
